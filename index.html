            <h4>
                The origin of the book
            </h4>
            <p>
                The first books were not on a Kindle. In those times, you could not carry around hundreds of books,
                digitalized on your phone. They were not even written on paper. The earliest books were carved on
                stone. Books were not written on paper until around 1500 A.D..

            <h4>
                The many uses of books
            </h4>
            <p>
                Books have recorded vital information for ages. Without books, we would not have Plato's Republic.
                School would be completely different. Dr. Seuss would be <strong>lost</strong> to us! There would be no written Bible!
                No one would believe an oral story as true.
            </p>

                Books are also a great way to pass time and relax. People become famous for writing books that can make
                you forget the time, they can become famous from books that are influential, to the point of action.
